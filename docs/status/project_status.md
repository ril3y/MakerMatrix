### Supplier Backend System Architecture

The supplier integration system has been redesigned with a focus on inventory enrichment and simplicity:

#### Core Components:
1. **SupplierCapability Enum**: Defines 7 essential capabilities
   - `GET_PART_DETAILS`: Comprehensive part information including specifications
   - `FETCH_DATASHEET`: Datasheet URL retrieval for documentation
   - `FETCH_IMAGE`: Product image URL fetching
   - `FETCH_PRICING`: Current pricing information
   - `FETCH_STOCK`: Inventory availability checking
   - `PARAMETRIC_SEARCH`: Advanced parameter-based filtering

3. Add tests for lib/ and parsers/ directories
4. Update deprecated code (Pydantic V2, PIL.ANTIALIAS)
5. Improve printer service test reliability

## 2025-01-06 - Code Analysis Update

### Error Handling Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of error handling patterns revealed significant inconsistencies:

#### Issues Found:
1. **Mixed Error Patterns**: Some modules raise exceptions, others return error dicts
2. **Unused Custom Exceptions**: `CategoryAlreadyExistsError` defined but never used
3. **Generic Exceptions**: Many modules use generic `ValueError` instead of custom exceptions
4. **Status Code Inconsistencies**: 500 errors returned for 404/409 scenarios
5. **Repository Layer**: `get_part_by_name` returns `None` instead of raising exception

#### Specific Examples:
- **Parts**: Properly uses `ResourceNotFoundError` and `PartAlreadyExistsError` ✓
- **Locations**: Manual 409 handling instead of custom exception ✗
- **Categories**: Returns success for duplicates instead of raising exception ✗
- **Users**: Returns `None`/`False` for not found, uses generic `ValueError` ✗

### Test Coverage Analysis

#### Well-Tested Modules:
- Authentication & Users (7 test files)
- Parts Management (3 test files)
- Categories (1 test file)
- Locations (3 test files)

#### Missing Test Coverage:
1. **Repository Layer**: No unit tests for any repository classes
2. **Services**: Missing tests for label_service, printer_service
3. **Routers**: No dedicated router tests
4. **Utilities**: No tests for parsers, printers, API integrations

### Recommendations Priority List

#### Priority 1: Standardize Error Handling (Critical)
1. Create additional custom exceptions:
   - `LocationAlreadyExistsError`
   - `UserAlreadyExistsError`
   - `InvalidReferenceError`
2. Refactor all modules to:
   - Repositories: Always raise exceptions
   - Services: Always raise exceptions
   - Routers: Catch and convert to HTTPException
3. Fix specific issues:
   - Make `get_part_by_name` raise `ResourceNotFoundError`
   - Use `CategoryAlreadyExistsError` in category service
   - Replace generic `ValueError` with custom exceptions

#### Priority 2: Add Repository Unit Tests (High)
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all repository classes
- Mock database connections
- Test CRUD operations and error scenarios

#### Priority 3: Complete Service & Router Tests (Medium)
- Add label_service tests
- Add printer_service unit tests
- Create router-specific validation tests

#### Priority 4: Code Quality Improvements (Medium)
- Update to Pydantic V2
- Replace deprecated PIL.ANTIALIAS
- Fix integration test database connections
- Add WebSocket foundation for ESP32
