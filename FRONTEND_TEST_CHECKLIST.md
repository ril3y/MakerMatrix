# 🧪 Frontend Integration Test Checklist

## Quick Manual Test to Verify Dynamic Supplier Capability Detection in UI

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Backend server running on https://localhost:8443
- ✅ Frontend running on https://localhost:5173  
- ✅ LCSC supplier configured (from our backend tests)

---

## 🎯 Test Steps

### 1. **Access Frontend**
1. Open browser to: `https://localhost:5173`
2. Login with: `admin` / `Admin123!`
3. Navigate to **Import** section

**✅ Expected:** Should successfully login and reach import page

---

### 2. **Test Supplier Detection**
1. Upload any CSV file (or drag & drop)
2. Look at the "Supplier/Parser Type" dropdown

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Should see suppliers loaded dynamically
- LCSC should show as "LCSC Electronics"
- Other suppliers (DigiKey, Mouser) should be visible
- No hard-coded supplier list

**📝 Check:** Are suppliers loaded from API? ___________

---

### 3. **Test LCSC Configuration Status**
1. Select "LCSC Electronics" from dropdown
2. Look for configuration status messages

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Should show LCSC as configured (green status)
- No "not configured" warnings
- Import should be available

**📝 Check:** Is LCSC showing as configured? ___________

---

### 4. **🌟 Test Enrichment Capabilities UI (KEY TEST)**
1. With LCSC selected, look for a **blue section** that says:
   - "**Enrichment Capabilities Available**"
2. Should see checkboxes for:
   - ⚡ **Part Details** (with Info icon)
   - 📄 **Datasheets** (with FileText icon)  
   - 💰 **Pricing & Stock** (with DollarSign icon)

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Blue section appears when LCSC is selected
- Shows available enrichment capabilities
- Has checkboxes with icons
- Includes helpful description text

**📝 Check:** Do enrichment options appear? ___________
**📝 Check:** Are capability checkboxes visible? ___________

---

### 5. **Test Other Suppliers (Error Handling)**
1. Try selecting "DigiKey Electronics"
2. Look for configuration warnings

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Should show yellow warning about "Partial Configuration"
- May show missing credentials warning
- Enrichment options should not appear (DigiKey not fully configured)

**📝 Check:** Does DigiKey show warnings? ___________

---

### 6. **Test Import Flow**
1. Select LCSC supplier
2. Check some enrichment capabilities 
3. Click "Import Parts" button
4. Watch for import progress

**✅ Expected Results:**
- Import should start
- Should see progress indication
- Should complete successfully
- Parts should be imported

**📝 Check:** Does import work with enrichment? ___________

---

## 🚨 **If Something Doesn't Work**

### **No Suppliers in Dropdown**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend is running on https://localhost:8443
- Check if `/api/import/suppliers` endpoint is accessible

### **No Enrichment Options**
- Verify LCSC is configured (should show green status)
- Check that LCSC shows "enrichment_available: true" in backend
- May need to refresh page after supplier configuration

### **Import Fails**
- Check CSV format matches LCSC requirements
- Verify supplier is properly configured
- Check browser console for errors

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

### **Backend Integration Working:**
- [x] ✅ Suppliers loaded dynamically from API
- [x] ✅ LCSC shows as configured  
- [x] ✅ Enrichment capabilities displayed
- [x] ✅ Import works with enrichment

### **UI Implementation Working:**
- [ ] 📱 Import page loads correctly
- [ ] 📦 Supplier dropdown populates dynamically
- [ ] ⚡ Enrichment capabilities section appears
- [ ] ✅ Configuration status shown correctly
- [ ] 🚀 Import flow works end-to-end

---

## 🎉 **Expected Final State**

After completing these tests, you should see:

1. **Dynamic supplier detection** - No hard-coded suppliers
2. **Capability-aware UI** - Enrichment options only for capable suppliers  
3. **Configuration awareness** - Clear status indicators
4. **Seamless workflow** - Import works with enrichment selection

**This confirms our dynamic supplier capability detection is fully integrated!** ✨
