# Cleanup Steps 1-6: Analysis Phase Details

## Step 1: Automated Dead Code Analysis (2025-01-08)
- **Backend**: 54 items found (17 unused imports, 37 test fixtures, 2 variables)
- **Frontend**: 30 modules with 80+ unused exports
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step1.md`

## Step 2: Manual Code Review - Backend Routes (2025-01-08)
- Analyzed 18 route files, found major consolidation opportunities
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  - Supplier functionality fragmented across 3 files (high priority)
  - Authentication duplicated in 4 endpoints (high priority)
  - 300+ lines of dead code in parts_routes.py (immediate cleanup)
  - Activity logging duplicated across 6+ files (medium priority)
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step2.md`

## Step 3: Manual Code Review - Backend Services (2025-01-08)
- Analyzed 30+ service files across 4 subdirectories
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  - Database session management duplicated ~50+ times
  - CRUD patterns duplicated across 6 services (~500 lines)
  - Printer services over-segmented (7 files need consolidation)
  - PartService too large (879 lines needs splitting)
  - Missing base abstractions causing massive duplication
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step3.md`

## Step 4: Manual Code Review - Frontend Components (2025-01-08)
- Analyzed 57 React components across 12 directories
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  - Import components 95% identical (LCSCImporter vs DigiKeyImporter)
  - Modal patterns duplicated with 80-85% code similarity (6+ components)
  - Form handling duplicated across all CRUD modals (~800 lines)
  - TasksManagement.tsx too large (1,276 lines needs splitting)
  - Missing generic modal system and form abstractions
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step4.md`

## Step 5: Manual Code Review - Frontend Services (2025-01-08)
- Analyzed 18 frontend API services plus test files
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  - Parts service data transformation duplicated 8 times (40% of service)
  - Duplicate WebSocket services with overlapping functionality (267+135 lines)
  - Settings service violates SRP (6 different domains in 307 lines)
  - Three different response handling patterns used inconsistently
  - Missing base CRUD service causing validation logic duplication
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step5.md`

## Step 6: Test Analysis (2025-01-08)
- Analyzed 100 backend test files (~26,056 lines) and 189 frontend test files (~5,925 lines)
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  - 17 temporary/debug test files identified for removal (556 lines)
  - Test fixture duplication across multiple integration tests
  - Authentication testing patterns duplicated across 8+ files
  - Missing test coverage for planned base abstractions and consolidated services
- **Report**: `analysis_report_step6.md`

## Key Findings Summary
- **Expected Impact**: 2,100+ lines reduction (20-30% of backend code)
- **Major Duplication Areas**: Database sessions, CRUD patterns, authentication, modals, forms
- **Architecture Violations**: Missing base abstractions, fragmented functionality
- **Test Issues**: Debug files, fixture duplication, missing coverage
