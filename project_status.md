# Project Status Updates

## 2024-03-21
- Refactored exception handling into a dedicated module for better organization
- Fixed database initialization by properly implementing FastAPI lifespan
- Improved error handling consistency across all routes
- Fixed failing tests related to category management
- Added proper database table creation on application startup

## Testing and Quality Assurance Status
- Unit Tests: ✅ Comprehensive test suite for all major components
- Integration Tests: ✅ Present but some failing due to database connection issues
- Test Coverage: ⚠️ 54% overall coverage
  - High coverage (>90%) in core modules
  - Low coverage in lib/ and parsers/ directories
- Error Handling: ⚠️ Most cases handled but some inconsistencies in status codes
- Code Quality: ⚠️ Well-organized but some deprecation warnings to address

### Next Steps
1. Fix database connection issues in integration tests
2. Address error handling inconsistencies (500 vs 404/409)
3. Add tests for lib/ and parsers/ directories
4. Update deprecated code (Pydantic V2, PIL.ANTIALIAS)
5. Improve printer service test reliability
