**Total Impact Achieved**: 120-190 lines eliminated, all 18 route files using consistent patterns
**Completion Result**: Step 11 at 100% completion and Phase 2 Backend Cleanup COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Proven BaseRouter Pattern Application Strategy
**For each remaining route file, apply the proven 4-step process:**

1. **Add BaseRouter imports**: `from MakerMatrix.routers.base import BaseRouter, standard_error_handling, log_activity, validate_service_response`
2. **Apply decorators**: Add `@standard_error_handling` and `@log_activity` where appropriate
3. **Replace try/catch blocks**: Use `validate_service_response()` for service calls
4. **Standardize responses**: Use `BaseRouter.build_success_response()` for all success cases

**Benefits achieved per file:**
- 20-40% line reduction
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Standardized response structure
- Improved maintainability and testability

#### 2. Fix Remaining Vulture Findings
**Clean up unused imports identified:**
- **`locations_routes.py`**: Remove unused `LocationResponse` import
- **`supplier_config_routes.py`**: Remove unused `InvalidReferenceError` import, fix unused `cls` variables
- **`utility_routes.py`**: Remove unused `sqlite3`, `LocationRepository`, `CategoryRepository` imports

**Expected Impact**: 6-10 lines eliminated, cleaner import structure

**Note**: `printer_routes.py` unused imports already cleaned up ✅
