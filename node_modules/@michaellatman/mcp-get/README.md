# mcp-get

A powerful command-line tool for discovering, installing, and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This tool simplifies the process of connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data sources, tools, and services.

With mcp-get, you can:
- Discover available MCP servers from our curated registry
- Install servers with a single command
- Manage environment variables and configurations
- Update and uninstall servers as needed

## Quick Start

Try mcp-get immediately:

```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest list
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

All packages added to the registry are automatically displayed on [mcp-get.com](https://mcp-get.com), making them discoverable to other users.

## About Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## What Packages Can You Install?

This tool helps you install and manage MCP servers that connect Claude to various data sources and tools, including:

- **Development Tools**: GitHub, GitLab

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher) for Node.js-based MCP servers

## Usage Examples

### Install a Package

```
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

Sample output:
```
Installing @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search...
Installation complete.
```

#### Install a Specific Version

You can also install a specific version of a package:

```
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search 1.0.0
```

Sample output:
```
Installing @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search version 1.0.0...
Installation complete.
```

The version syntax follows standard package manager conventions:
- For Node.js packages: `package@version` (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search@1.0.0`)
- For Python packages: `package==version` (e.g., `mcp-server-aidd==0.1.19`)
- For Go packages: `package@version` (e.g., `example.com/go-server@v1.0.0`)

## Adding Your Own MCP Server to the Registry

There are two ways to add your MCP server to the registry:

### Option 1: Manual Package Addition

If you want to maintain your own package:

1. **Create Your MCP Server**: 
   - Develop your MCP server according to the [MCP protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
   - Publish it as either an NPM package (installable via npm) or a Python package (installable via uvx)

2. **Add Your Package to the Package Folder**: Add your server as a JSON file in the `packages/` directory:

   - For regular packages, use `packages/your-package-name.json`
   - For scoped packages, use `packages/scope--package-name.json` (double hyphens between scope and name)

   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-package-name",
     "description": "A brief description of your MCP server",
     "vendor": "Your Name or Organization",
     "sourceUrl": "URL to the source code repository",
     "homepage": "URL to the homepage or documentation",
     "license": "License type (e.g., MIT)",
     "runtime": "node | python | go",
     "environmentVariables": {
       "SOME_API_KEY": {
         "description": "Description of what this key is for",
         "required": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Important notes:
   - The `name` field must be the exact resolvable package name in npm or pip
   - The `runtime` field specifies how your package should be installed:
     - Use `"runtime": "node"` for packages that should be installed via npm
     - Use `"runtime": "python"` for packages that should be installed via uvx
   - Always include an `environmentVariables` object (can be empty `{}` if none required)

3. **Validate Your Package**: Run the PR check to validate your package:
   ```
   npm run pr-check
   ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Fork this repository, add your package file, and submit a PR.

### Option 2: Community Servers Repository

If you don't want to manage package deployment and distribution:

1. **Fork Community Repository**: 
   - Fork [mcp-get/community-servers](https://github.com/mcp-get/community-servers)
   - This repository follows the same structure as the official MCP servers

2. **Add Your Server**:
   - Add your implementation to the `src` directory
   - Follow the existing patterns and structure
   - Include necessary documentation and tests

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Submit your PR to the community servers repository
   - Once merged, your server will be automatically added to the registry

Both options require following the [MCP protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Choose the option that best fits your needs:
- Option 1 if you want full control over your package distribution
- Option 2 if you want to avoid managing package deployment and distribution
